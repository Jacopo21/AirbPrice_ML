# HM2
Second Assignment Prediction

Founded in 2008, Airbnb is a homestay marketplace that allows home-owners or hosts to list their properties, or listings online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Though Airbnb gives general giudelines to hosts for prices based on the listing type, rooms, accomodation etc. hosts usually set their own prices for their listings. A detailed pricing study is important and relevant for New York which is Airbnb's biggest market in USA and faces lot of competition from hotels.

# Project Objective:
